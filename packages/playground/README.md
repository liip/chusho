# Chūshō playground

A Vue app to develop and test the components and tools.

## Usage

Ensure you have [bootstraped the monorepo](https://github.com/liip/chusho#project-setup) and [build a local version of the library](https://github.com/liip/chusho/tree/main/packages/chusho#build-for-production) first.

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Playing while modifying the library

If you make changes in the core library, you must build it again for the playground to pick it up.
